            <h2>About turtle hatchery</h2>
            <p><br>One of the most important activities of the project is its hatchery. Within the sanctuary of the project, collected and rescued
                eggs can hatch safely away from predators before being released into the sea. In addition, a certain number from each hatching 
                are kept back for a short period for 'headstarting' before release.
                <br>
                Dudley Perera's project has been underway since 1988.  The main aim of the project is to monitor local sea turtle activity and 
                conserve the local nesting sites.  We aim to make the public more aware of how endangered these beautiful creatures are and just 
                how important it is to help protect them before it is too late</p>

        <h2>Volunteer work at Kosgoda</h2>
        <p><br>KSTCP is proud to host international volunteers who assist with the operation of the project and/or undertake local community 
            development projects. In return, volunteers gain valuable experience participating in local projects - learning about turtles, 
            turtle conservation, the local community, Sri Lanka and plenty more besides! Placements with the project commence from one week
             to twelve week duration.
             <br>
             Volunteering at the KSTCP is a very hands-on experience involving beach conservation work, maintenance of the turtle hatchery,
              turtle feeding (and cleaning!) and even taking tours round the project for locals and tourists.</p>

    <h2>Histroy of the hatchery</h2>
    <p><br>his is the oldest Conservation and Research project started in Sri Lanka in early 1978. It was at a time when all 7 species of 
        sea turtles were on the Endangered list. Of the 7 species, 5 of the species were found to be frequenting the beaches of the 
        southern coast of Sri Lanka where they beached, to lay their eggs. These eggs were collected by the villagers and sold in the 
        open market.
         <br>
         Thanks to Victor Hasselblad and Dr.Zylva and Dr. Wickremesinghe, the turtles have found a safe haven and they are increasing
          in numbers. It is a wonderful experience to see the hatchlings, once released on the beach, rushing to catch the first wave.</p>
